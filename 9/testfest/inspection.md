## Program Inspection

- [20/20] for an accurate and helpful self evaluation. 

_Points_

- [24/40] Each of these functions should have a good name or a purpose statement.
  - [6/10] Top-level scoring method. 
  - [6/10] Find players that have visited the highest number of goals 
  - [6/10] Compute their distances to the home tile
  - [6/10] Pick those with the shortest distance as winners
    - For saying you didnt do it.
- [20/40] These functions should have unit tests

   - Do not write all your unit tests in one function. Its hard to figure out which assert is testing what. Also Could not        accertain that you have least one test with a state that has no players
